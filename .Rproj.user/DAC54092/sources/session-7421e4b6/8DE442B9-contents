#### Typeset Example: Spearmans rmarkdown

$$\ r_s = 1 -\left(\frac{6\sum_{}D^2}{n(n^2-1)}\right)$$

# Images

Note that you must use out.width and out.height to scale external images (fig.height and fig.width wonâ€™t work), e.g.,

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "20%"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/Culture.jpeg")

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

``` r
# Data Manipulation----
ox <- data %>% 
  gather("year", "pop", 25:69) %>%  # Reshape data to long form
  filter(Common.Name == "Musk ox",  # Filter for species of interest: Musk ox 
         Region ==  "Europe",  # Filter for the European populations (filter out Canada; not geographically or geo-politically European and only has 2 samples of very different values: would create unbalanced model)
         !is.na(as.numeric(pop))) %>%  # Remove non numeric population counts ('NA's)
  mutate(year = parse_number(year),  # Remove characters from 'year' column to allow model to treat as integer variable.
         pop = as.integer(pop),   # Poisson requires response variable to be integer 
         year2 = I(year-1969)) # To stop repeating this function in the model
```

# Libraries

```{r libraries, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```
